        I am a professional Software Engineer who has spent the last two years employed as a .Net developer,
         working primarily with the MVC framework. During this time I have worked within a large organization and a small start-up, 
        and have cultivated a record of meeting client expectations and designing elegant solutions to complex problems.

        I entered college as a chemistry major, but took an introductory programming course out of curiosity.
        After the first week of the class I changed my major to computer science. Making use of mathematics, engineering, 
        and logic appealed immensely to my academic interests, and even the most simple of programming tasks made use of my life long passion for problem solving. Since entering the professional sphere, my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills have proved invaluable in completing projects on time and on budget. However, if I had to name my most valuable trait, it is the ability to learn new things.

            It is not with pride, but with anticipation, that I present my CV.
            For while I took joy in detailing all I've accomplished in two years as a professional,
            it truly excites me to imagine what it may look like in two more.

            Being raised to strive for humility, I have always worried about selling myself short to potential clients or employers.
